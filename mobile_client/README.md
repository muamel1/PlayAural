# PlayAural Mobile Client

The PlayAural mobile client is an Android-first Expo and React Native app for the PlayAural multiplayer game platform. It uses the same WebSocket protocol and sound directory layout as the desktop and web clients, while providing a self-voicing touch interface for mobile play.

The client is part of PlayAural and is licensed under the **GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE**.

## Features

- Self-voicing gesture navigation for menus, game actions, chat, and message history
- Real mobile identity on the server with `client: "mobile"`
- Touch-client game menus shared with the web client through server-side capability checks
- Login, registration, password reset, saved credentials, and auto-login
- Local configuration storage with AsyncStorage
- Credential storage with SecureStore
- Bundled sound pack playback with music fades, ambience, sound effects, and positional audio
- Mobile-specific TTS voice, engine, and rate preferences with safe device fallback
- Server-synchronized account preferences
- Version and sound-pack checks before gameplay
- Android APK builds through EAS

## Project Layout

```text
mobile_client/
|-- app.json
|-- eas.json
|-- package.json
|-- locales/
|   |-- en/client.json
|   `-- vi/client.json
|-- scripts/
|   `-- generate-sound-manifest.mjs
|-- sounds/
|-- src/
|   |-- app/
|   |-- audio/
|   |-- generated/
|   |-- gestures/
|   |-- i18n/
|   |-- network/
|   |-- state/
|   `-- tts/
`-- tsconfig.json
```

The `sounds/` directory intentionally mirrors the desktop sound-pack layout. A sound pack can be copied into `mobile_client/sounds/` without renaming folders.

## Requirements

- Node.js LTS
- npm
- Android device, emulator, or browser for web-runtime testing
- EAS CLI for cloud Android builds
- Optional: Android Debug Bridge (`adb`) for USB port forwarding

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd mobile_client
cmd /c npm install
```

Generate the bundled sound manifest after changing `sounds/`:

```bash
cmd /c npm run generate:sounds
```

Run TypeScript validation:

```bash
cmd /c npm run typecheck
```

## Running the Client

Start the Expo dev server:

```bash
cd mobile_client
npx expo start
```

Run the web test runtime:

```bash
cd mobile_client
npx expo start --web -c
```

The web runtime is a development/testing target. Browser TTS voices can differ from Android TTS voices because the browser uses the Web Speech API while Android uses the device TTS service through Expo Speech.

## Server Connection

The default production server URL is stored in `src/app/PlayAuralApp.tsx` as `DEFAULT_SERVER_URL`:

```text
wss://playaural.ddt.one:443
```

For local server testing, change that constant to a local WebSocket URL such as:

```text
ws://127.0.0.1:8000
```

If testing on a physical Android device over USB, forward the local server port:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000
```

With the reverse tunnel active, `ws://127.0.0.1:8000` on the device reaches the server running on the development computer.

For LAN testing, use the computer's LAN IP address instead:

```text
ws://192.168.1.50:8000
```

The phone and development computer must be on the same network, and the firewall must allow the server port.

## Version and Build Metadata

Mobile version and build identifiers are stored in:

- `src/app/PlayAuralApp.tsx`: `MOBILE_CLIENT_VERSION`
- `src/app/PlayAuralApp.tsx`: `MOBILE_BUILD_STAMP`
- `app.json`: `expo.version`
- `package.json`: package version
- `package-lock.json`: locked root package version

The client sends `MOBILE_CLIENT_VERSION` to the server during authorization. The UI displays `MOBILE_BUILD_STAMP` on the login screen for build verification.

## Sound Manifest

The generated sound manifest is written to:

```text
src/generated/soundManifest.ts
```

Regenerate it whenever sound files are added, removed, or renamed:

```bash
cmd /c npm run generate:sounds
```

## Android Builds

Install and authenticate EAS CLI:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
```

Build the preview APK:

```bash
cd mobile_client
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

Build the production profile:

```bash
cd mobile_client
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

Build profiles are configured in `eas.json`. Expo app metadata is configured in `app.json`.

## App Identity

The Android package name and iOS bundle identifier are public application identifiers:

- `app.json`: `expo.android.package`
- `app.json`: `expo.ios.bundleIdentifier`

The EAS project id in `app.json` identifies the Expo project used for cloud builds. It is not an authentication token and is safe to keep in the public repository. Do not commit Expo access tokens, keystores, signing credentials, local credentials, `.env` secrets, or generated build output.

## Generated Files and Local Artifacts

The repository tracks source files, configuration files, locale files, and the generated sound manifest. The repository does not track generated build output or dependency folders such as:

- `mobile_client/node_modules/`
- `mobile_client/.expo/`
- `mobile_client/dist/`
- `.mobile_eas_stage/`
